# How to configure SMTP

To configure the SMTP Integrator integration you'll have to set the following configuration options with the appropriate values for your SMTP server by running `juju config [charm_name] [configuration]=[value]`.

The SMTP server host needs to be specified as `host`. The rest of the configurations might not be needed depending on your SMTP server configuration.

For more details on the configuration options and their default values see the [configuration reference](https://charmhub.io/smtp-integrator/configure).
