  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing a SMTP Integrator on Kubernetes. SMTP s a communication
  protocol used for sending and receiving email messages over the Internet.

  This charm simplifies configuration of SMTP by providing a single point
  of configuration for all the requirers using the same SMTP server. It can be
  deployed on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io)
  to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes
  offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy to manage and propagate SMTP configuration, while
  giving the freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating any charm leveraging the SMTP
  protocol simple and straightforward through Juju's clean interface.
